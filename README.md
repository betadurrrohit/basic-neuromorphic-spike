# Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Simulation

This repository contains a simple implementation of a
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model.

The project is aimed at building intuition for
neuromorphic computing and spiking neural systems.

## Why LIF?
The LIF model captures essential neuronal dynamics:
- Membrane potential integration
- Leak (decay)
- Threshold-based spike generation
- Reset mechanism

## Relevance
This project serves as a foundational step toward
neuromorphic computing, brain-inspired AI,
and future research in BCI and organoid intelligence.ssssss
